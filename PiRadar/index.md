## üì° PiRadar

A real-time semicircular radar interface built with **Python** and **Pygame**, running on a **Raspberry Pi 5**.

Uses an **SG90 servo** and **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to sweep from 30¬∞ to 150¬∞, visualizing nearby objects as pulsing blips on a semi-circular display.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- üîÑ Smooth servo sweep via `lgpio`
- üìè Real-time distance readings with `HC-SR04`
- üß≠ Semi-circular HUD with distance rings
- üí° Pulsing blips for objects detected under 120 cm
- üéØ Optimized for full-screen HDMI display
- üíª Built and tested on Ubuntu (Raspberry Pi 5)

> üí° If you're looking to replicate this project, note that the development environment was set up using **Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi**.
