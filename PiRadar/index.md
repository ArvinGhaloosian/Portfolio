## 📡 PiRadar

A real-time semicircular radar interface built with **Python** and **Pygame**, running on a **Raspberry Pi 5**.

Uses an **SG90 servo** and **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to sweep from 30° to 150°, visualizing nearby objects as pulsing blips on a semi-circular display.

### ⚙️ Features

- 🔄 Smooth servo sweep via `lgpio`
- 📏 Real-time distance readings with `HC-SR04`
- 🧭 Semi-circular HUD with distance rings
- 💡 Pulsing blips for objects detected under 120 cm
- 🎯 Optimized for full-screen HDMI display
- 💻 Built and tested on Ubuntu (Raspberry Pi 5)

> 💡 If you're looking to replicate this project, note that the development environment was set up using **Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi**.
